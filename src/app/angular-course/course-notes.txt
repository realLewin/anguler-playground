important note about the course structure:
I treat the `angular-course` as the course root directory,
every course section corresponding to the `section-<number>` file,
in the `section-<number>` file, I treat it as a seperate project,
so I use app.module.ts for each section;
I treat main.component.ts as the section root component;

noticing course: 2.28;
